# Learn Rust Fantasy Adventure

This is a programming course that teaches the Rust programming language through a series of puzzles
and programming minigames set in a magical fantasy adventure world. This course is intended to be
suitable both for those with no prior programming experience, and for those coming from another
programming language.

There are a lot of good Rust learning resources out there already, but I've found them to be
tremendously dry on the whole. This should hopefully be a much more engaging and inspiring way to
learn the language.
